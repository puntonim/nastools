# nasutils

Set of utils I use for some typical Network Attached Storage operations. Mostly in Python, Bash and Makefile.

## Setup
Create `config.ini` (see `config.ini.template`)


## Utils list
See `readme.md` in each dir.

### Dedupe
Compare and deduplicate files and dirs.


## Development
When writing Python code, try to:
 - write code compatible with Python 2 and 3 so that it works in old and new macOS versions
 - do not use any external library, so that no virtualenv is necessary. This way scripts work in any vanilla macOS.
